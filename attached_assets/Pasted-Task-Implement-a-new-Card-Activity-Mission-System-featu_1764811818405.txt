Task: Implement a new "Card Activity Mission System" feature for DeckForge.

Feature Overview:
- Deck creators can add card activities to their decks (similar to merge perks).
- Initial activity type: Mission. (Versus and Tournament activity types will be added later.)
- Only the deck creator can configure card activities.
- Missions are tied to card attributes and scale based on rarity.

Workflow:
1. Deck Creator UI
   - On the "Edit Deck" page, add an "Add Card Activity" button.
   - User clicks button and is directed to the new "Edit Card Activity" html page.
   - User enters name into the name field for this mission template
   - User selects activity type from a drop-down ("Mission" only for now).
   - Mission-specific parameters become visible:
     - Mission requirement (select a numeric card attribute, e.g., Payload Capacity).
     - Minimum requirement value (e.g., 85,000).
     - Success reward credits (e.g., 1,500).
     - Mission duration (e.g., 48 hours).
     - Mission description.
   - Display note: "Use Mythic missions as a basis, since mission parameters scale based on rarity."

2. Mission Parameters
   - Random mission drops apply ±5% variance to requirements, rewards, and duration.
   - Mission rarity is randomized; scaling adjusts values based on rarity. 
   - Higher rarity missions have a longer duration, lower rarity missions have a shorter duration.
   - Success rates by rarity (example for Legendary missions):
     - Common: 40%
     - Rare: 65%
     - Legendary: 90%
     - Mythic: 99%
   - No mission should ever have 100% success.
   - Merged cards provide a diminishing bonus (+5% credits per merge level).

3. Mission Posting
   - Missions are sent to the `card_activity_channel` selected by the deck creator/adopter.
   - If no channel is selected, missions remain disabled.
   - Bot monitors chat activity in accessible channels:
     - Minimum activity: 10 messages between at least 2 users.
     - Missions spawn hourly if activity threshold is met.
     - More activity increases chance of higher rarity missions.

4. Mission Acceptance
   - Missions appear as embeds with parameters, success rates, and acceptance cost.
   - Acceptance cost = 5% of reward credits, deducted upfront.
   - Users must react within 20 minutes to accept.
   - Acceptance requires at least one card meeting minimum requirements.
   - Mission lifecycle:
     - `pending` → user has 1 day to start with `/startmission [card_name]`.
     - `active` → mission runs for set duration.
     - `completed` → success/failure determined by rarity; credits rewarded on success.
     - `rejected` → user cancels mission.
     - `expired` → user fails to start within 1 day or misses reaction window.
   - Cooldown: 4 hours between mission acceptances per player.

5. Transparency
   - Mission embed must display:
     - Mission parameters (requirement, minimum value, reward, duration, description).
     - Success rates per card rarity.
     - Acceptance cost (5% of reward).
   - Example embed:
     ```
     🚀 Mission: Payload Delivery [LEGENDARY]
     Requirement: Payload Capacity ≥ 85,000
     Reward: 1,500 credits (Acceptance cost: 75 credits)
     Duration: 48 hours
     Success Rates: Common 40% | Rare 65% | Legendary 90% | Mythic 99%
     Description: Deliver critical supplies to the frontier.
     ```

Implementation Notes:
- Add mission state machine (`pending`, `active`, `completed`, `rejected`, `expired`).
- Track per-user cooldown (`last_mission_accept_time`).
- Deduct credits immediately upon acceptance.
- Log mission events for auditing and debugging.
- Ensure multiple missions can coexist per server, but enforce per-user cooldown.
