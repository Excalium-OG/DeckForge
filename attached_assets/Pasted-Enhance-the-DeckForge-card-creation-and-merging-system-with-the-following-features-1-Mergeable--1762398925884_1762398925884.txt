Enhance the DeckForge card creation and merging system with the following features:

1. Mergeable Attribute
   - Add a boolean toggle field `mergeable` when creating a new card.
   - If true, the card can participate in merge operations.
   - All mergeable cards start at merge_level = 0.

2. Merge Levels
   - Add an integer field `max_merge_level` (default 10, configurable per card).
   - Track current `merge_level` per card instance.
   - Merging requires 2 cards of the same ID and same merge_level.
   - Pyramid logic: to reach level L, requires 2^L base cards.

3. Merge Perks
   - Add a new field `merge_perks` to card templates.
   - `merge_perks` is a list of integer-based characteristics already defined in the card template (e.g., Strength, Payload Capacity).
   - On the **first merge (level 0 → 1)**, the player must choose one perk from `merge_perks`.
   - That perk is locked to the card and becomes its growth path.
   - On subsequent merges, the same perk is automatically boosted.

4. Perk Scaling
   - Perk boost follows diminishing returns:
     - Base boost = P0 (e.g., +10)
     - Each new level adds P0 * d^(L-1), where d < 1 (e.g., 0.85).
   - Example: Level 1 = +10, Level 2 = +8.5, Level 3 = +7.2, etc.
   - Store applied perks in a `card_perks` table with fields: card_id, level_applied, characteristic_name, perk_value.

5. Merge Costs
   - Use the rarity based recycle value as the cost of the first card merge
   - Merge cost scales exponentially:
     - Cost(L) = C0 * r^L, where C0 = base cost, r = scaling factor (e.g., 1.25).
   - Deduct credits from user balance on each merge.

6. Discord Integration
   - Add a Discord command `/merge` that:
     - Accepts two card IDs of the same merge_level.
     - Validates eligibility (mergeable, same level, credits available).
     - On first merge, prompts the user to select a perk from `merge_perks`.
     - On subsequent merges, automatically applies the locked perk boost.
     - Returns a confirmation message with new merge_level, perk applied, and updated stats.
     - When viewing /mycards, cards are displayed differently by merge_level
     - /cardinfo will now have an optional merge_level field which will display the card with listed merge level as well as the perk boost, if applicable

7. Database Changes
   - `cards` table: add fields `mergeable`, `merge_level`, `max_merge_level`, `recycle_cost_credits`, `locked_perk`.
   - `card_perks` table: track perk progression per merge level.
   - Ensure transactions are atomic to prevent duplicate merges.

8. UI / Templates
   - In the card creation form, add:
     - Checkbox for "Mergeable"
     - Numeric input for "Max Merge Level" (default 10)
     - Numeric input for "Recycle Cost (credits)"
   - Display merge_perks options when mergeable is checked.

Goal: Players can create mergeable cards, select a perk path at the first merge, and progressively upgrade that perk through merging, with costs and boosts scaling according to the formulas above.
